## Abstract
In the landscape of online retail, understanding customer behaviour and preferences is paramount for effective marketing strategies and enhanced sales. Segmentation of customers based on transactional and behavioural similarity between each other is very much helpful in the Online Retail field. It gives a thorough understanding of the way customers belonging to a particular segment spend their money and what kind of products they prefer to buy by analysing the spending pattern of other customers in that segment or cluster. This project aims to connect data analysis with marketing strategies, giving retailers the tools to improve how they reach customers and grow their business in the constantly changing online market. Our primary objective is to transform a raw transactional data that is collected from a retailer, and available online, into a customer-centric dataset favourable to segmentation analysis. This involves data cleaning procedures to handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers, ensuring the integrity and reliability of our dataset. Further, we engage in feature engineering process to generate new variables, based on the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), model that encapsulate crucial aspects of customer behaviour and transaction history. Then we employ the K-means clustering algorithm and partition the customers into distinct clusters based on the features in the Customer centric data built from the initial transactions data. We then evaluate the clusters (segments) through the k â€“ means cluster evaluation metrics and proceed to the next step of building a recommendation system to enhance cross-selling opportunities and boost sales. The recommendation system uses cluster-specific product recommendations, suggesting top-selling items to customers within each segment who have yet to make corresponding purchases. This personalized approach aims to increase marketing effectiveness by presenting customers with products aligned with their preferences and purchase history, thereby increasing sales and customer loyalty. This project emphasizes the importance of customer segmentation in the field of online retail by recommending products bought by the customers of their segment and thus helping increase the customer satisfaction and sales. Through the integration of advanced analytics techniques and machine learning algorithms we contribute to enhancing customer experiences and sustainable business growth.
