# Customer Segmentation and Product Recommendation

## Abstract
In the landscape of online retail, understanding customer behaviour and preferences is paramount for effective marketing strategies and enhanced sales. Segmentation of customers based on transactional and behavioural similarity between each other is very much helpful in the Online Retail field. It gives a thorough understanding of the way customers belonging to a particular segment spend their money and what kind of products they prefer to buy by analysing the spending pattern of other customers in that segment or cluster. This project aims to connect data analysis with marketing strategies, giving retailers the tools to improve how they reach customers and grow their business in the constantly changing online market. Our primary objective is to transform a raw transactional data that is collected from a retailer, and available online, into a customer-centric dataset favourable to segmentation analysis. This involves data cleaning procedures to handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers, ensuring the integrity and reliability of our dataset. Further, we engage in feature engineering process to generate new variables, based on the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), model that encapsulate crucial aspects of customer behaviour and transaction history. Then we employ the K-means clustering algorithm and partition the customers into distinct clusters based on the features in the Customer centric data built from the initial transactions data. We then evaluate the clusters (segments) through the k â€“ means cluster evaluation metrics and proceed to the next step of building a recommendation system to enhance cross-selling opportunities and boost sales. The recommendation system uses cluster-specific product recommendations, suggesting top-selling items to customers within each segment who have yet to make corresponding purchases. This personalized approach aims to increase marketing effectiveness by presenting customers with products aligned with their preferences and purchase history, thereby increasing sales and customer loyalty. This project emphasizes the importance of customer segmentation in the field of online retail by recommending products bought by the customers of their segment and thus helping increase the customer satisfaction and sales. Through the integration of advanced analytics techniques and machine learning algorithms we contribute to enhancing customer experiences and sustainable business growth. 

## 1. Introduction

In the dynamic landscape of online retail, understanding customer behaviour and preferences is paramount for devising effective marketing strategies and driving sales growth. Marketers increasingly recognize the importance of customer segmentation as a strategic tool for enhancing customer service and maximizing business value. By dividing customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics and behaviours, marketers can tailor their offerings and communication strategies to meet the specific needs of each segment, thereby fostering enhanced customer engagement and loyalty. Customer segmentation studies involve the comprehensive analysis of customer data, encompassing demographic information, purchasing patterns, and other relevant metrics. By leveraging advanced analytics techniques, marketers can derive actionable insights from vast datasets, enabling the identification of homogeneous customer groups with distinct preferences and behaviours. This segmentation analysis lays the foundation for targeted marketing initiatives, allowing marketers to allocate resources more efficiently and drive personalized interactions with customers. 

### 1.1 Customer Behaviour and Features
One critical aspect of customer segmentation is the consideration of customer lifetime value (CLV), which reflects the potential long-term revenue or profit generated by a customer over their entire relationship with a business. By segmenting customers based on the features that determine CLV, marketers can prioritize resources and tailor marketing strategies to maximize the value derived from each customer interaction. This "action-centric" segmentation approach shifts the focus from immediate transactional outcomes to long-term customer relationships, thereby optimizing marketing effectiveness and driving sustained business growth. 
Another vital aspect in understanding customer behaviour and optimizing segmentation strategies involves the RFM model, an effective tool used by marketers to analyse and categorize customers based on three key metrics: recency, frequency, and monetary value. Recency refers to how recently a customer has made a purchase, highlighting their engagement and interaction with the brand. Frequency assesses how often a customer makes purchases, indicating their level of loyalty and propensity for repeat business. Monetary value quantifies the amount of money a customer spends, providing insights into their purchasing power and potential profitability. By examining these dimensions of customer activity, marketers gain a nuanced understanding of individual behaviours and preferences, allowing for targeted and personalized marketing efforts. Integrating the RFM model into segmentation analyses enhances the granularity of customer profiling, enabling marketers to identify high-value segments and tailor strategies to effectively engage and retain these valuable customer segments. This refined approach not only optimizes short-term transactional outcomes but also nurtures long-term customer relationships, driving sustained business growth and profitability. 

### 1.2 Customer Segmentation
Various methodologies exist for customer segmentation, each offering unique insights into consumer behaviour and preferences. While traditional demographic segmentation remains a foundational approach, more advanced techniques have emerged, including clustering algorithms powered by machine learning. Among these, hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering stand out as prominent examples of unsupervised learning algorithms widely employed for customer segmentation tasks. Hierarchical clustering arranges customers into a hierarchical tree-like structure, where clusters at higher levels encompass broader similarities, while those at lower levels represent more granular distinctions. In contrast, K-means clustering partitions customers into distinct clusters based on similarities in their purchasing behaviour and preferences. This algorithm iteratively assigns data points to clusters and optimizes cluster centroids to maximize within-cluster similarity and minimize between-cluster variance. The K-means algorithm's appeal lies in its scalability and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for handling the vast datasets characteristic of e-commerce applications. Moreover, its ability to generate meaningful segmentation results enables marketers to derive actionable insights for crafting targeted marketing strategies and personalized product recommendations tailored to specific customer groups. Through the application of K-means clustering and similar techniques, marketers can unlock deeper insights into consumer behaviour, fostering enhanced engagement and driving business growth in the competitive landscape of online retail. 

### 1.3 Product Recommendation system 
Product recommendation systems are integral components of modern e-commerce platforms, revolutionizing the customer shopping experience by delivering personalized product suggestions aligned with individual preferences and past purchasing behaviour. These systems utilize sophisticated algorithms that analyse vast amounts of customer data, including browsing history, purchase patterns, and demographic information, to generate tailored recommendations tailored to each user's unique preferences and interests. By leveraging insights derived from customer segmentation analyses, recommendation systems can further enhance their effectiveness by customizing product suggestions to align with the preferences of specific customer segments. Through clustering customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics and behaviours, marketers gain valuable insights into the types of products that resonate most with each segment. By identifying popular products among customers within each cluster, recommendation systems can intelligently suggest similar items to other customers in the same segment, maximizing cross-selling opportunities and driving incremental sales growth. Moreover, recommendation systems continuously refine their algorithms through machine learning techniques, enabling them to adapt to evolving customer preferences and market trends over time. As a result, these systems not only enhance the customer shopping experience but also contribute significantly to revenue generation and customer satisfaction in the competitive landscape of online retail. 

In this project, we aim to leverage customer segmentation techniques, particularly K-means clustering. By clustering customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behaviour, we intend to identify common preferences and characteristics within each segment. Subsequently, we will develop a product recommendation system that suggests top-selling products to customers within each segment who have not yet made corresponding purchases. Through this approach, we aim to enhance marketing effectiveness, drive sales growth, and foster increased customer satisfaction in the competitive landscape of online retail.
